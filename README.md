# Introduction to Scikit-Learn (sklearn) ðŸ“š

![Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) is one of the most popular and powerful machine learning libraries in Python. It provides simple and efficient tools for data mining, data analysis, and machine learning, and it is built on top of NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib.

## ðŸš€ What Scikit-Learn Offers

Scikit-learn supports a wide range of machine learning tasks, including:

- **Classification** (e.g., SVM, Random Forest, k-NN, Logistic Regression)
- **Regression** (e.g., Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso)
- **Clustering** (e.g., K-Means, DBSCAN, Agglomerative Clustering)
- **Dimensionality Reduction** (e.g., PCA, t-SNE)
- **Model Selection** (e.g., GridSearchCV, cross-validation)
- **Preprocessing** (e.g., scaling, encoding, imputation)

## ðŸ§  Common Classification Models in Scikit-Learn

| Model | Classifier | Description |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| Decision Tree | `DecisionTreeClassifier` | Tree-based model that splits data using decision rules |
| Neural Network | `MLPClassifier` | Multi-layer Perceptron (feed-forward neural network) |
| Logistic Regression | `LogisticRegression` | Linear model for binary and multi-class classification |
| k-NN | `KNeighborsClassifier` | Classifies based on nearest neighbors in the feature space |
| Random Forest | `RandomForestClassifier` | Ensemble of multiple decision trees |
| SVM | `SVC` | Finds the hyperplane that best separates classes |

## ðŸ”¬ What This Project Does

In this project, we focus on **comparing two popular classification models** from scikit-learn:

### ðŸŒ³ Decision Tree Classifier
A simple, interpretable model that makes decisions by asking a sequence of yes/no questions based on the features.

### ðŸ§  MLP Classifier (Neural Network)
A more complex model that uses layers of artificial neurons to learn patterns in data â€” great for capturing non-linear relationships.

## ðŸ†š Why Compare?

Comparing different models helps us:

- Understand which model performs better on a given dataset
- Learn how different algorithms behave
- Visualize results and draw insights

You can find the detailed steps and results in the following two projects:
